Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine a subset of items to include in a collection
so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

The knapsack problem is in combinatorial optimization problem. It appears as a subproblem in many, more complex mathematical models
of real-world problems. One general approach to difficult problems is to identify the most restrictive constraint, ignore the others,
solve a knapsack problem, and somehow adjust the solution to satisfy the ignored constraints.

In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. 
This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem.
